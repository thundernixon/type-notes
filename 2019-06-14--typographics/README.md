## TypeLab: Stephen Coles, Nick Sherman: Fonts In Use

We started Fonts in Use because it was something we wanted to see in the world.

It's hard to know what fonts are being used, where. Magazines often credit everyone *except* the type designers. Meanwhile, type specimens show imagined uses, but nothing real.

We even have (several) RSS feeds!
